Changes in Brython version 3.3.1
================================


New features
============
- Javascript constructors (referenced by window.js_constructor) have an 
  attribute "new", a function that returns instances created by the
  constructor. This feature deprecates the JSConstructor function in
  module javascript.
  
Implementation
==============
- major rewriting of functions implementation : 1. remove the "finally" block
  (for performance reasons) and insert code to exit the function execution
  frame 2. wrap function definition in an anonymous self-executing function, 
  with an object holding function default values as argument
- improve rendering of speed tests (in /speed/index.html)
- rewrite the function that tests if an object is a DOM Node
- improve repr() of dict.keys, dict.values, dict.items
- generator "next" functions are no longer converted to an escaped string
- method remove() of DOMNode instance becomes the same as method of same name 
  on DOM elements : elt.remove() removes the element

Bug fixes
=========
- bug with tuple hash (reported on the group)
- bug with operators applied to dicts or sets
- bugs in py_set.js
- bug with dict.fromkeys()
- bug with classmethods of native types
- report correct line num for syntax errors in lambdas
- bug in dict.setdefault : argument "default" is optional and defaults to None
- in "with ctx_manager as obj", obj was not bound in namespace
- bug with several ** arguments
- bug with "continue" inside generators
- bug in comparisons between integers and long integers
- error in message printed by __BRYTHON__.imports()

Issues
- #356 : "struct" module is missing the "Struct" class
- #542 : expansion of f(*my_args, a, b) inverses order of arguments + 
  implement PEP 448 (at least partially)
- #543 : incorrect behavior of sets: {''} | {0} gives {''} and discards 0
- #545 : scoping oddity: "for k in range(k)" leads to skipping the loop
- #547 : tuples behaving as mutable
- #549 : operators **=, //= and so on don't work on float variables
- #550 : "a & b" throws error on bool variables: & and | operators are absent
- #551 : -1; (minus and semicolon) in the source line causes Brython to create
  a tuple
- #553 : Variable name shadowed in list comprehension scope crashes: 
  [s for s in s]
- #554 : default argument initializer called more than once: def g(arg=f())
- #556 : math functions (i.e. sin, log, etc.) do not accept as input objects 
  that implement __float__ method
- #557 : remove child element issue
- #558 : a set isn't properly cloned by "a = set(b)" statement
